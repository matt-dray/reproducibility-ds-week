DfE Data Science Week, 2020-01-22

???
* Spoiler: you will believe them
* And you probably are doing them already
* But hopefully you'll hear about something new

---

tl;dr

* make everything reproducible
* unless you hate everyone
* especially yourself

---

'Reproducible'?

---
class: middle

Can I recreate what you did:

* from scratch?
* on a different machine?
* in the future?
* without you present?

???
* We should know all the preparatory steps
* Maybe I don't have the same packages, maybe I'm using another OS
* Dependency changes break things
* What if you leave the department?

![](img/turing-way-reproducibility.jpg)

From [The Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.com/introduction/introduction) by The Alan Turing Institute

???
* I think we care about reproducing outputs we've aready created (to prove that we can relaibly recreate the outcome) and updating with fresh data (like the next quarter's data)

---
class: middle

Whyyyyy?

* automate your work
* speed things up
* reduce errors
* improve trust

???
* build it from start to finish at any time
* know exactly what is happening in your workflow
* other can redo it themselves

???
* There's a grassroots movement to enact all this stuff in government already
* #rap-collaboration on govdatascience.slack.com
* DfE are already active: speak to your RAP Champion

Three things

---
class: middle

1. Encode and centralise the thing
2. Write reports with code
3. Use a workflow manager

???
* These are very broad -- what do they mean?
* Let's go through one by one
* I'll be focusing on R, but I think the points are transferable and Python analogues are available

---
class: inverse, middle

1. Encode and centralise

???
* Reconsider disparate, distributed files and data
* Reconsider Excel
* Pointing and clicking can go wrong

---
class: middle

[horrible Excel examples]

---
class: middle

Use [R Projects](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200526207-Using-Projects)

* code, data and docs in one place
* use [{renv}](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html) for [dependency management](https://ukgovdatascience.github.io/rap-website/article-dependency-and-reproducibility.html)

???
* Code _and_ data _and_ documentation in one place
* You can easily pass the Project folder as a single unit
* Filepaths are relative to the the project, not your machine

---
class: middle

Write packages

* don't repeat yourself
* try the [{usethis} workflow](https://www.hvitfeldt.me/blog/usethis-workflow-for-package-development/) by Emil Hvitfeldt
* check out the [book](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/) by Hadley Wickham

???
* Write, test and debug your frequently-used functions just once
* The whole organisation and beyond can use the same functions
* Put this under version control so you can always refer to older versions of your package

---
class: middle

Consider:

* [{here}](https://here.r-lib.org/) for [relative file paths](https://github.com/jennybc/here_here)
* [Git and maybe GitHub](https://speakerdeck.com/alicebartlett/git-for-humans) for version control 

---
class: inverse, middle

1. Encode and centralise the thing &#10004;
2. Write reports with code

---
class: middle

Use [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/)

* put code in your reports
* updates automatically after changes
* read the [R Markdown book](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/) 

???
* From code chunks or inline
* New data? No problem. Re-run the code and the correct outputs are generated.

---
class: middle

Use R Markdown for other outputs:

* {xaringan}
* {bookdown}
* {blogdown}
* {flexdashboard}

1. Encode and centralise the thing &#10004;
2. Write reports with code &#10004;
3. Use a workflow manager

---
class: middle

Use {drake}

* remembers your workflow
* re-runs only what needs to be re-run
* see the [website](https://docs.ropensci.org/drake/) and [user manual](https://books.ropensci.org/drake/)

???
* You can't remember all the parts of your large analysis and how they fit together
* Do you have to re-run everything from scratch if you change something about the analysis?
* {drake} is a brain that remembers all the relationships and the order in which things need to be run
* It only re-runs what needs to be re-run, saving you time and brainpower
